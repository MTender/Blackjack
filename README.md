# Blackjack
A game of command line based Blackjack.

Development is currently happening mainly on branch v2.0.

v2.0 is at this time fully functional and also includes a fix for the multiple splits issue.

The rules are introduced at the beginning of the game, however, future plans include making the game more customisable without having to edit the source code.
